# HiWi Assignment

## Overview

This project is designed to assess programming skills in Python, focusing on path planning algorithms. It involves implementing an efficient path planning algorithm to find the shortest path between two points in a given space, simulating challenges in robotics navigation and manufacturing automation. The project includes three tasks: basic path planning, integration of waypoints, and handling terrain data.

## Getting Started

Before running any of the tasks, ensure you have Python installed on your machine and the necessary libraries by installing them using the requirements.txt file provided. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Task 1: Basic Path Planning

**Objective:** Implement a path planning algorithm in a 5x5 grid to find the shortest path between two points, avoiding obstacles.

**File:** `task1_path_planning.py`

**Instructions:**

1. Navigate to the directory containing `task1_path_planning.py`.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```
   python task1_path_planning.py
   ```
3. The grid, path, and obstacles in the generated plot will be shown.

### Task 2: Integration of Waypoints

**Objective:** Extend Task 1 to include two waypoints that must be visited in the shortest path calculation.

**File:** `task2_waypoints.py`

**Instructions:**

1. Navigate to the directory containing `task2_waypoints.py`.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```
   python task2_waypoints.py
   ```
3. The updated path including waypoints will be visualized in the generated plot.

### Task 3: Varying Terrain

**Objective:** Enhance the path planning implementation by incorporating terrain data, simulating elevation changes.

**File:** `task3_terrain.py`

**Instructions:**

1. Navigate to the directory containing `task3_terrain.py`.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```
   python task3_terrain.py
   ```
3. The path planning process considering terrain data will be visualized in the generated plot.
